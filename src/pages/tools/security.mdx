## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://www.tenderly.co/) offers security tools to help developers build and maintain secure dapps and  smart contracts. 

* Configure [Tenderly Alerts](https://docs.tenderly.co/alerts/intro-to-alerts?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=ink) for notifications on transactions and contract events. Use [Alerts API]() to set up custom alerts with highly granular triggering criteria.
* Use [Web3 Actions](https://docs.tenderly.co/web3-actions/intro-to-web3-actions?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=ink) to automate predefined responses, improving security and user experience.
* Leverage [Simulation RPC](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations/single-simulations#simulate-via-rpc?mtm_campaign=ext-docs&mtm_kwd=ink) to predict transaction outcomes such as asset changes, precise gas usage, and emitted events.
